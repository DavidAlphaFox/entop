                   ntop - A top-like Erlang node monitoring tool
================================================================================

Ntop is a tool which shows information about a remote Erlang node in a way which
is similar to unix 'top'. It needs (at least) Cecho 0.3.0 
(http://www.github.com/mazenharake/cecho) to run. See the section "Usage" to see
what commands that are supported.

== Compiling ==
Just run make.

== Usage == 
To run ntop make sure you have Erlang installed and that the cecho library
(http://www.github.com/mazenharake/cecho) is available in your Erlang code
path. The start script assumes that you run it inside the ntop application root
directory, if you don't want that then change the paths in the scripts
accordingly or just make sure you have the ebin/ directory for ntop in your
Erlang code path. Look at the start script for more details.

Usage: ./ntop <TARGETNODE> [-name <NAME>|-sname <SNAME>] [-setcookie <COOKIE>]

> ./ntop foo@11.0.1.2 -name ntop@11.0.1.3 -setcookie secret

Commands when running ntop:
[1-N]: Sort on column number 1 through N. Starts with first column (1) and up to
    N where N is the last column.
    
r:
    Toggles the sorting order from ascending to descending and vice versa.

q:
    Quits ntop and return to the shell.

Ctrl-C:
    Same as 'q'.

'<' and '>':
    Moves the sorting column to the left or right respectively
